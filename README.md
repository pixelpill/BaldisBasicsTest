Welcome to a fully functional site with Baldi's Basics
If you want to use this for your site, please go to the "clbaldisbasics.html" file and copy the code
If you fork this repository to try to make the game unblocked on a new githhub pages site it will not allow the fork to be public meaning forks don't work
Instead, make a new github repository, make a new file in it called "Index.html" and copy and paste the code from "clbaldisbasics.html" or "index.html" from this repo (either one will work) then make sure your repository is public then go to the pages section and select "deploy from a branch" under "build and deployment" then select the "main" branch and after that select the "/ (root)" folder and press the save button and the site wil be live at yourusername.github.io/reponame/        (it sounds like a lot but its really not hard at all its very simple and most of the settings are default to the correct ones. good luck if you even read all of this, but you wont need it since its SUPER easy












If you see any bugs or glitches to the the "issues" tab and make an issue. i will check the issues and read your reports , when fixed i will close the issue
